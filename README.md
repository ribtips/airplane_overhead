Tracking planes that are flying over a specific location

Plan: The plan for this project is to build some software that works with a 1090 antenna to track flights that appear over a specific lat/long.  Ultimately, working with a raspberry pi and LED display, it would present this information so that people can always have an idea of what is flying overhead.
